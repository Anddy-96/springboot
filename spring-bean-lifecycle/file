in this folder you can understand the lifecycle of bean 
like init method amd the destroy method - init method is initiated when bean is created and destroy is called when bean work is completed 
destroy method can be seen working in singleton scope only, in prototyoe scope- ther are differnet bean created everytime so destroye method is called - client has to have some logic to call some ending method
we can make custom method where we can check when the bean is ending in prototype scope and call the destroye method
